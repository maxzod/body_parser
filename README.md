# Motivation

we need some thing line express.js body-parser
we found that `angle` body parser is good enough for us but it was outdated so we forked it and polish the code every thing still the same just

- removed the unused dependence's
- support null safety
- use linting

# Usage

if you are using `palace` you don't need this package its already shipped with palace and works fine out of the box
else look for the original repository we just polish the code little bit
